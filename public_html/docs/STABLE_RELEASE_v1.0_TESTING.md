## üîß Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### Audio Not Working

**Symptom:** No audio on calls or feature codes

**Check:**
1. Firewall allows UDP ports 10000-20000
2. STUN server reachable: `stun.l.google.com:19302`
3. Codecs match: ulaw, alaw, gsm
4. NAT configured properly

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Check RTP ports
asterisk -rx "rtp show settings"

# Check STUN
asterisk -rx "pjsip show settings" | grep stun

# Reload if needed
asterisk -rx "core reload"
```

### Registration Fails

**Symptom:** Can't register extension

**Check:**
1. Extension credentials correct
2. Server IP correct (flexpbx.devinecreations.net or 64.20.46.178)
3. Port 5060 not blocked
4. Endpoint exists in Asterisk

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Check endpoint
asterisk -rx "pjsip show endpoint 2001"

# Check registration attempts
asterisk -rx "pjsip show registrations"

# Check for auth failures
grep "auth" /var/log/asterisk/messages | tail -20
```

### Voicemail Not Working

**Symptom:** Can't access voicemail or leave messages

**Check:**
1. Mailbox exists: `asterisk -rx "voicemail show users"`
2. Sound files present: `ls /usr/share/asterisk/sounds/vm-*`
3. Permissions correct: Files owned by asterisk
4. Module loaded: `asterisk -rx "module show like voicemail"`

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Check voicemail users
asterisk -rx "voicemail show users for flexpbx"

# Reload voicemail
asterisk -rx "module reload app_voicemail_imap.so"

# Check permissions
chown -R asterisk:asterisk /usr/share/asterisk/sounds/
```

### Web Interface Not Loading

**Symptom:** Admin or user portal shows error

**Check:**
1. Apache/Nginx running: `systemctl status httpd`
2. PHP working: Create test.php with `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`
3. Permissions: Files readable by web server
4. File exists at path

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Restart web server
systemctl restart httpd

# Check permissions
chmod 755 /home/flexpbxuser/public_html
chmod 644 /home/flexpbxuser/public_html/admin/*.html

# Check PHP
php -v
```
