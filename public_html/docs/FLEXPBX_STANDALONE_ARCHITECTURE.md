# FlexPBX Standalone Architecture & Accessibility

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Purpose:** Document FlexPBX as a standalone, accessible FreePBX alternative

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**FlexPBX is designed to be:**

✅ **Standalone First** - Works without WHMCS, WHM, or cPanel
✅ **Accessible By Design** - Screen reader friendly for employment opportunities
✅ **Asterisk Native** - Built directly on Asterisk, not external dependencies
✅ **Optional Integration** - Plays nice with WHMCS/cPanel IF they exist
✅ **Self-Contained** - All features work from base installation
