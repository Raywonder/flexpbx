                    SIP CLIENT RECOMMENDATIONS

PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Telephone (macOS)
  • URL: https://www.64characters.com/telephone/
  • Free, open-source
  • Excellent VoiceOver support
  • Clean, simple interface

  • Perfect for accessibility testing

ALTERNATIVES:
  • Zoiper (https://www.zoiper.com/) - Multi-platform, free version
  • Linphone (https://www.linphone.org/) - Free, open source

are the current method for using extensions.
