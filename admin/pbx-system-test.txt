● ✅ SIP & Trunks are Now Working!

  I've successfully configured your FlexPBX system with working SIP
  extensions and trunk connectivity. Here's what's ready:

  🎉 What's Live:

  5 PJSIP Endpoints Configured:
  - Extensions: 2000 (Admin), 2001 (Test User), 2002 (Demo), 2003 (Support)
  - CallCentric Trunk with DID (302) 313-9555 and (281) 301-5784

  Dialplan Features:
  - Extension-to-extension calling
  - Voicemail for each extension
  - Voicemail access (*97)
  - Echo test (9196)
  - Inbound DID routing to extension 2001
	
  📞 Quick Test - Register a Phone:

  Use any SIP softphone (Zoiper, Linphone, etc.):
  Username: 2001
  Password: FlexPBX2001!
  Domain: flexpbx.devinecreations.net
  Port: 5060

  Then dial 9196 for echo test, or register another phone as 2002 and call
  between them.
  Use prefix "09" for all outbound calls:

  | What You Dial     | What Gets Called                 |
  |-------------------|----------------------------------|
  | 092813015784      | +1-281-301-5784 (US/Canada)      |
  | 095551234567      | +1-555-123-4567 (US/Canada)      |
  | 09011442012345678 | +44-20-1234-5678 (International) |
  | 09411             | 411 (Directory)                  |

  ⚠️  IMPORTANT: 911 Emergency Calling is DISABLED for safety during testing!
  ⚠️  Do NOT attempt to dial 911 - it will NOT connect to emergency services.

  Internal calls (extensions, IVR, voicemail) - NO prefix needed!
